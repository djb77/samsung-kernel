BCM4361 DHD 100.11.5 for Android STAR Project
(Notes: 100.11.x is twigged off from 100.10.163)

DHD 100.11.5 - 2018.04.30
Major Issue
 - CS4449537(By Huang Junming) Fixed the packet delay with TPLINK AP on Tencent site
     * Issue summary
       While running the Game application using TPLINK AP,  packet delay is detected at the Game server side
     * Analysis / Root cause
       According to Air sniffer log, AP couldn't receive 802.11 Ack or Block Ack frame which DUT sent on the noisy environment
       If TPLINK lost AMPDU these frames, AP holds frames which already received during 1 second
     * Solution
       Increase LRL(Long Retry Limit) from 6 to 12 to increase the opportunity to receive frame on AP side

Major Issue
 - CS4079439(By Cho Seong Ji) Added the additional spin lock and debugging implementation to protect DMA map/unmap synchronization and logging the history for Exynos9810 platform
     * Issue summary
       Kernel Panic was happened during VoIP test
     * Analysis / Root cause
       1. Kernel panic was occurred due to SMMU fault from the IOMMU driver
       2. From the initial analysis of Samsung S.LSI, unsynchronization between DMA map and unmap could lead the SMMU fault issue
     * Solution
       1. Added new spinlock to sync up for DMA map/unmap implementation in the OS dependent layer of DHD to avoid the issue
       2. Provided the debug codes to narrow down the issue once it is reproduced

 - CS4139777(By Kwak Hogil) Removed PKT filter ID 107: IPv4 Broadcast filter
     * Issue summary
       VOWIFI mute issue happened after LCD off
     * Analysis / Root cause
       In this network, netmask is 255.255.253.0 so DUT IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.255 is not Broadcast.
       But it was filtered by IPv4 Broadcast filter (ID 107)       
     * Solution
       First, removed packet filter ID 107 not to block this unicast packet in this kind of network

 - CS4228470(By Kwak Hogil) Fixed ARP offload flag not to clean up Host IP address/ARP table after roaming done
     * Issue summary
       AP failed to do ARP resolution after roaming completed
     * Analysis / Root cause
       There was roaming patch code which clean up Host IP address/ARP table in DHD
       From Android O, DHCP is not run after roaming if some requirements meet on framework side
       So Host IP address was not set again in this case and it caused the problem ARP request was dropped after roaming
     * Solution
       It was caused by ARP_OL_HOST_AUTO_REPLY option that has not been used and not needed for Samsung model
       Fixed to not use it, not to clean up Host IP address/ARP table after roaming done

     * Issue summary

Major Issue

     * Issue summary
       N-DRIVE download TPUT was lower than the GN8 (Great) device
     * Analysis / Root cause
       DHD TCP ACK suppress enable/disable controlled by ARGOS notification callback by current TPUT
       Problem is DHD TCP ACK suppress is enabled by default for GS9 because GS9 does not use ARGOS feature in DHD
     * Solution
       Disabled DHD TCP ACK suppress in DHD Makefile for GS9
       DHD TCP ACK suppress is replaced by TCP delayed ACK

 - CS4048984(By Min SungBin) Skip dumping PCIe registers if PCIe link down has occurred
     * Issue summary
       The Kernel panic was triggered due to System MMU fault
     * Analysis / Root cause
       1. The PCIe link down has occurred before the Kernel panic
       2. The System MMU fault was triggered when host tried to access the configuration registers in EP
       3. It seemed that RC doesn’t allow host to access any EP registers after the PCIe link down has occurred
     * Solution
       To avoid the Kernel panic, skip dumping any PCIe registers in EP if PCIe link down has occurred

 - CS4050389(By Jeong Min Cheol) Fixed kernel panic due to unexpected suspend during DHD_LOG_DUMP
     * Issue summary

     * Analysis / Root cause
       Wpa_supplicant triggered DEBUG_DUMP and then runtime suspend was entered
       ITMON detected that dhd_log_dump tried to access pci bus after runtime suspend at this time 
     * Solution
       Adding wakelock for avoiding unexpected runtime suspend during DHD_LOG_DUMP

 - CS4050409(By ahn joongmin) CS4078469(By Seo Jung Kuk) CS4078386(By Cho Seong Ji) CS4075752(By Cho Seong Ji) Fixed kernel panic due to duplicate free in pktlogging feature
     * Issue summary
       Kernel Panic has happened due to duplicate skb free in pktlogging feature
     * Analysis / Root cause
       Two different DHD threads indicated same function (dhd_pktlog_ring_get_writebuf) in the log
       The reason is that it's a critical section but there was no synchronization object in the pktlog function
     * Solution
       Added spin lock to protect critical section
